AI Project Nathaniel Lowis 2020.

Prerequistes:
Java 11 or later (No guarantee that the code will work in any earlier Java Version)
JavaFX on machine
Logger4 on the machine

This is an AI Project. 
It implements these Algorithms to a certain degree:
Regression (Linear and Non linear and multivariable and univariate),
Logistic Regression (Linear MultiVariable),
Depth First Search,
Breadth First Search,
Q-Learning,
K Nearest Neighbour
Ant Colony Optimisation

The Graph class used throughout requires that the nodes are numbered 0,..., n with n being the number of nodes - 1.  I will try and make this not a requirement soon.
Please only add one edge between 2 nodes as well

Note:
This is not finished at the moment.  It has not been fully tested.  As well, if you enter an incorrect input the code WILL fail.  I will add error catching code and make it easier for the user to use soon.
